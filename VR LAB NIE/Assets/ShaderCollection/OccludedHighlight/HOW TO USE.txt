Thank you for using my asset. Below are some instruction of setting things up:
1. Create a new material:
- Create a new material in the Project window then select one of these 3 shaders:
 . Pinwheel/OcculdedHighlight: only draw the occluded part of an object
 . Pinwheel/StandardOccludedHighlight: draw both visible and occluded part of an object, with standard shader workflow
 . Pinwheel/StandardSpecularOccludedHighlight: draw both visible and occluded part of an object, with standard specular shader workflow

2. Parameters:
Occluded Highlight section
- Highlight Color: determine its pattern texture and tint color
- Tiling/Offset: pattern tiling/offset
- Threshold: thickness of the silhoulette
- Mode: choose between Smooth and Sharp highlight mode

Other sections:
- Other parameters work the same way Unity Standard shader do. Please take a look at Unity official documentation for detail.
